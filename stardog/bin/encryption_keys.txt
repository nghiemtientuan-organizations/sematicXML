# This file is NOT secure for production.  It is part of the encryption at rest
#  feature PREVIEW.  Please use for encryption evaluation and testing only.
#
# File format:
#
#  The pound / number sign / hash tag begins a comment through the end of line.
#
#  Each key line contains a key description, a colon, and a 64 character key.
#
#  The first key line is used for new writes.  The first and all subsequent key
#   lines are used for reading.  The current write key's description goes into
#   a special prefix within each new file.  The encryption feature will later match
#   the description written within each file to the appropriate key for reading.
#
#  The key description can be any text.  Spaces before and after are ignored.  The
#   description CANNOT BE CHANGED once used for writing.  The description must stay
#   the same for a given key forever.
#
#  The encryption key must be exactly 64 characters long.  It may only contain
#   hexadecimal numbers / letters:  zero to nine, a to f (upper or lower case).
#
#  It is possible to disable writing new files with encryption.  Give a description
#   and colon only for first key line.
