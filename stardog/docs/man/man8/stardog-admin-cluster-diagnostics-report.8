.TP
\fB\-i\fR
This option allows you to include a list of additional specific files\. By default, the command includes any \.log files in $STARDOG_HOME, including stardog\.log, zookeeper\.log and starrocks\.log, as well as audit\.log and access\.log if have them\. It will also include stardog\.properties\. In some cases the default set (which can be seen with the \-\-dry\-run option) will not include all the needed information for a specific system\. If you know of something relevant that should be included in the zip file, this option can be used to include it\. This option can be specified multiple times\.

\fB\-\-krb5\-disable\-rdns\fR
Disable reverse DNS lookup for Kerberos clients\.
.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR
The path to the report output file\. By default, the command will create a file called stardog\-report_YYYY\-MM\-DD_hh\-mm\-ss\.zip in your current directory\. When using this parameter, you must specify a full file path\.

If the JVM arg isn\'t set, the default value \'http://localhost:5820\' is used\. If server URL has no explicit port value, the default port value \'5820\' is used\. Example: \'stardog\-admin \-\-server http://12\.34\.56\.78:5820 server stop\'
